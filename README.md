## ref(lect)log

this is a git-integrated agentic CLI tool. I say 'git-integrated' because this is not supposed to be a general purpose coding agent; it has a focus. this project is meant to be an exercise for me as a reflective practitioner, to hone my own understanding of the practice of writing code and what it means for an agentic tool to work with the traces of my own reflexivity while I write code. for example, git can be such a trace. git regularly makes us step back and think about what it actually is what we did (`git commit -m '[...]'`).

I am learning to code. this tool is not exactly a tool that I make because it will improve expert performance. I am not an expert. expert performance is about flow, some measure of no-thought, immersion, if you will. learning means a certain load of cognitive surplus work ("what did i just do?", "how does this relate to x/y/z", "did i just learn something?"/"do i know how to do this?", etc. etc.) and this work has output. it should not exclusively happen in your head. you need to write about it, read up on it, think about it, again and again. this is reflexivity. it is us thinking about how we actually learn/work/approach things - loops & feedback, essentially. do you see where this is going? why LLM agency works well in this setting?

there are other reasons, too:

sometimes I come back to a repo and think "I have 0 clue where I am. what was I thinking?". this is where the idea originally came from. I wanted some kind of CLI command like `> whoami`... like ... `> whereami`. 

I have to add: reflective practice is not something we can outsource. this is important. reflexivity is essential to good practice (hot take). this is also where it gets pretty confusing in my head: I feel like a lot of the performance of fully fledged coding agents depends on these tools really "understanding" what it is that we do when we programm. where we are at, where come from, and where we are going. some of that "understanding" is backed into the black box. some of it is not. that's my guess. as I said: I am still mildly irritated about this train of thought.
