## why reflectlog
this is a git-integrated agentic CLI tool. I say 'git-integrated' because this is not supposed to be a general purpose coding agent; it has a focus. this project is meant to be an exercise for me as a reflective practitioner, to hone my own understanding of the practice of writing code and what it means for an agentic tool to work with the traces of my own reflexivity while I write code. git can be such a trace. git regularly makes us step back and think about what it actually is what we did (`git commit -m '[...]'`). but there are more traces, implicit stuff about programming as an objectified, sequencialized procedure, or, as Donald Schoen used to call it, tacit knowledge.

this is as much an exploration of what knowledge/ideas about a program are not sufficiently represented by program text and/or annotated program text as it is an exploration of whether or not this "missing" or "shaded" context of programming is retrievable and operationalizable for the programmer and an agentic program.

## where to go from here
what I can see somewhere down the road: a data structure of my own reflexive approach and some sort of model context protocol that can help LLMs better simulate what I am doing when I write a program. but I also have the suspicion that some of these things cannot be expressed at all.

## disclaimer
I am learning. this tool is not exactly a tool that I make because it will improve expert performance. I am not an expert. expert performance is about flow, some measure of no-thought, immersion, if you will. learning means a certain load of cognitive surplus ("what did i just do?", "how does this relate to x/y/z", "did i just learn something?"/"do i know how to do this?", etc.) and this work has output. it should not exclusively happen in your head. you need to write about it, read up on it, think about it, again and again. this is reflexivity. it is us thinking about how we actually learn/work/approach things - loops & feedback, essentially.

I have to add: reflective practice is not something we can outsource. this is important. reflexivity is essential to good practice (hot take). this is also where it gets pretty confusing in my head: I feel like a lot of the performance of fully fledged coding agents depends on these tools really "understanding" what it is that we do when we program. where we are at, where come from, and where we are going. some of that "understanding" is baked into the black box. some of it is not. that's my guess.
