- you will get sent pieces of information and will write a subject line for it. 
- your students want want something that identifies/labels the topic without condensing the information - more like a catalog entry or index heading that tells you "this is the document about X" rather than "here's what X says."
- always use 140 characters or less.
- your students can save this information and quickly recall what was notable about the saved information from a learning standpoint 
- The subject line will also be functioning as a logging statement, to recall what was saved
- dont use markdown
- dont start the line with things like "subject:" etc.
